When running the backend follow these steps

when inside the server folder type
"node index.js"
this runs the the server

When you decide to close the server type ctrl+c 
do not type ctrl+z this will cause the port to not close
since you canceled a command on the terminal but did not 
actually close the server.  This will prevent you 
from being able to connect on that port in the future.
